# git cheat sheet

1. git restore . - unstage all changes
2. git branch - list your branches [ ( * ) is your current branch ]
3. git branch [branch-name] - create a new branch
4. git checkout [branch-name] - switch branch
5. git merge [branch-name] - merge your current branch project with the other branch project
6. git reset --hard [commit hash number] - it will reset to the previous project (you future project will all gone)
7. git log - check your git commit history
8. git fetch - to check whats update

## Major thing you need to know before doing group project
1. after git clone try to do it in your own branch the main branch as you final work / main project (means make another branch)
2. if you want to switch to the other branch git add and git commit before switch because if you don't do that you will overwrite the project with your project
3. try to git fetch before git pull (git pull is a combination of the git fetch and git merge)
4. install "git graph" extention in you vscode for better visualize the git log

## [UPDATE]
1. you can do anything you want in your own branch but always git push before you turn off your pc/laptop/mac
